Qiestion 1) Explain the difference between dynamic polymorphism and dynamic binding ?

     Dynamic polymorphism is about overriding the methods from the parent class and and with the
     help of dynamic poymorphism that is ovverriding we can reduce the code.when we create
     object of the parent class with the help child class and when we invoke the overriden methods 
     the first prefference will get to the chaid class methods.
 
     Dynamic binding is not a type of polymorphism; rather dynamic binding is how polymorphism
     is "implemented" or how it works. And dynamic binding and runtime binding are the same thing.
     it can also be called "late binding".when we create the obect of parent class inside the child
     class then whith the help of that object we call to the different methods that is called the    
     dynamic binding.
