Question 2)
	
	Basically thread has four states.
	
	1) New
	2) Active
	3) Blocked / Waiting
	4) Terminated

   1) New : in this state we create the thread or we manufactures the thread.

   2) Active : to active the thread we need to invoke the thread uding the start method.
      then the thread gets activate. 
      
   3) Blocked : Whenever a thread is inactive for a span of time 
      then, either the thread is in the blocked state or is in the waiting state.
      thread scheduler descides that which thread will run first. mostly the thread
      whish has the max priority they will work first.
      
   4) Terminated : When a thread has finished its job, then it exists or terminates normally.
