	Generics in Java
	Generics deal with type-safe objects. It makes the code stable by detecting the bugs at compile time.

	Before generics, we can store any type of objects in the collection, i.e., non-generic. Now generics force the java programmer to store a specific type of objects.

	Advantage of Java Generics
	

	1) Type-safety: We can hold only a single type of objects in generics. It doesnt allow to store other objects.

	Without Generics, we can store any type of objects.

	2) Type casting is not required: There is no need to typecast the object.

	Before Generics, we need to type cast.

	3) Compile-Time Checking: It is checked at compile time so problem will not occur at runtime. The good programming strategy says it is far better to handle the problem at compile time than runtime.
